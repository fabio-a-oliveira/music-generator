    "## Creating original computer-generated music inspired by Bach's chorales\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we create a model that will be able to generate original music after being trained on a large corpus comprised of J.S. Bach's chorale pieces.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Some high-level features of this work: \n",
    "* This project is inspired by an exercise proposed in chapter 15 of the _Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow_ book. You can check out the author's implementation in [this notebook](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/15_processing_sequences_using_rnns_and_cnns.ipynb)      \n",
    "* The model is based on an architecture consisting of stacked Gated Recurrent Units followed by a dense layer, regularized with droupout, and stabilized with layer normalization,          \n",
    "* Training is performed in a many-to-many scheme: at each step, the model tries to predict the next note (as opposed to a many-to-one scheme, where the model would be exposed to a sequence of notes and try to predict the last one)   \n",
    "* The dataset is available at [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml2/master/datasets/jsb_chorales/jsb_chorales.tgz) and contains _.csv_ files for each of the pieces    \n",
    "* The dataset is split into train (229 pieces), validation (76 pieces) and test (77 pieces) partitions (yes, Bach was a tremendous workaholic!)   \n",
    "* Each sample in the _.csv_ files contains 4 integer values ranging from 36 to 81 corresponding to 4 notes (one for each of the four voices) that are sung simultaneously, with an uniform note duration of half a beat      \n",
    "* In order to train the model, each note is converted to a one-hot encoding to represent each of the possible notes, plus 0 for silence and -1 to indicate the end of a piece\n",
    "* The dataset is augmented so that, before each training epoch, each of the pieces is randomly transposed by a number of steps in the range of -5 to 6 - this ensures that the model is equally exposed to musical patterns in all different keys   \n",
    "* After training, the model is used to generate new music one note at a time by choosing each note randomly according to the probabilities generated by the softmax layer of the neural network      \n",
    "* The original music is saved to midi files using the _mido_ package"

    "\n",
    "1. Power scheduling has been set to gradually decrease the learning rate as the training progresses. This type of scheduling is more severe in the beginning of the training, and becomes more mild at later epochs, which allows the training algorithm to learn the easier patterns in the beginning of training with a higher learning rate, and to be more parcimonious with the more sophisticated patterns learned near the end. The parameters of the scheduling have been set to that the learning rate reduces to around 1/2 of it's original value after 40 epochs, then to 1/3 after 40 more epochs and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. A reduce-on-plateau callback has been set, which reduces the learning rate by a ratio of 0.3 every time training reaches the end of an epoch without an improvement of the loss metric as measured in the validation set. The patience term has been set at 1, meaning that the callback will reduce the learning rate after only 1 epoch without improvement. This may seem drastic, but the dataset has been drastically augmented (by a factor of 12), so each epoch contains a significant amount of gradient descent steps.\n",

    "Additionally, gradient clipping has been applied to curb the updates to the parameters in order to make training more stable and reduce sudden dips in performance due to an overshoot of promising parameter regions. The use of gradient clipping has reduced the incidence of the reduce-on-plateau callback, allowing the optimizer to keep a higher learning rate for longer without jeopardizing performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final form of regularization, an early-stopping callback has been set in order to interrupt training after a number of epochs without improvement to the validation loss. The parameter setting _restore_best_weights = True_ ensures that the final model retains the best performance observed during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is batched into sequences of 256 notes, or 64 notes per voice, which amounts to 8 bars of music per sequence (considering eighth notes). This allows the network to pick up on relatively long musical patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "The appropriate loss is _categorical cross entropy_ - related to the model's ability to predict the next note correctly with a high degree of confidence. Accuracy is also measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model contains around 240,000 trainable parameters. The model is set to train for 100 epochs, but the early-stopping usually halts the training between 40 to 70 epochs. The full training process takes around 24 hours on a typical CPU."
